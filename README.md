# 💼 Deloitte Virtual Internship — Data Analytics & Forensic Technology

> **Certificate of Completion Issued by Deloitte via Forage — May 2025**

## 🧠 Project Summary

During the Deloitte Virtual Internship on Forage, I completed a data analytics simulation involving **real-world telemetry data** from a multinational manufacturing company, Daikibo. The objective was to analyze machine downtime across factories worldwide using **Tableau**.

## 🏭 Internship Challenge: Daikibo Case Study

**Client:** Daikibo — A manufacturing giant operating in:
- 🇯🇵 Tokyo (Factory Meiyo)
- 🇯🇵 Osaka (Factory Seiko)
- 🇩🇪 Berlin
- 🇨🇳 Shenzhen

**Problem Statement:**
- Identify the **factory with the highest machine downtime**.
- Determine **which device types fail the most** in that location.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Tableau** (Dashboard & Visual Analytics)
- **Excel** (Equality Table Analysis)
- **Data Cleaning** and transformation

## 📊 Approach & Steps Followed

1. Imported raw telemetry JSON data into Tableau.
2. Created a **calculated field `Unhealthy`** to flag unhealthy machine messages (every 10 minutes).
3. Built:
   - A **bar chart**: 📍 *Down Time per Factory*
   - A **bar chart**: ⚙️ *Down Time per Device Type*
4. Developed an **interactive dashboard** allowing drill-down by factory.
5. Identified top failure location and most problematic machines.

## 📌 Key Insights

- 🏭 **Factory with Highest Downtime:** *(Based on analysis — add screenshot or factory name here)*
- ⚙️ **Most Failing Machine Type:** *(Add the machine type from your dashboard here)*
